## JS has an active community.

- *node.js*: JavaScript on the server
- Workflow: GitHub -> publish on npm (node package manager)
- Repercussions:
    1. Packages used by others, bug reports etc.
    2. Contact with Athan Reines, data scientist in Silicon Valley who works on statistics libraries in JS
    3. Google Summer of Code: port C/C++ codebases via *emscripten* for high-performance numerical computing
- Goal: offerings comparable to *scipy* and *numpy* for JS
